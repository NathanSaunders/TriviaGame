# Trivia Game - Star Wars

##### Homework Assignment 5: Basic Quiz - Timed Form

This is a fun and interactive trivia game that runs in your web browser, it is the Basic Version of the Unit 5 Homework covering JavaScript & jQuery. The game was styled with Basic CSS (no templates). I started with the Star Wars theme simply because I saw a version on GitHub I really enjoyed. It was coded in such a way that I can easily change the questions or add more to the list.
